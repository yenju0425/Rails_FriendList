# Friens List App

This is my Friends List app, which is an excellent exercise for learning Ruby on Rails. You can follow my Git commits to create your own Friends List app using the latest version of Rails and Bootstrap. However, please note that the YouTube tutorial below was published in 2020 and may not be compatible with the latest versions.

By working on this project, you will gain hands-on experience in several key areas, including:

* Installing Rails
* Using basic command operations in Rails
* Setting up a database system and integrating it with Rails
* Enhancing the user interface with Bootstrap
* Understanding the fundamental framework of Rails and its capabilities

This project offers a great opportunity to develop your skills and deepen your understanding of Ruby on Rails. Happy coding!
