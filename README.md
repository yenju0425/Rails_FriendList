# Friens List App

Welcome to my Friends List app - a great exercise for learning Ruby on Rails! By following my Git commits, you can easily create your own version of the Friends List app using the latest versions of Rails and Bootstrap. However, please note that the YouTube tutorial below was published in 2020, so some elements may not be compatible with the latest versions.

By working on this project, you will gain hands-on experience in several key areas, including:

* Installing Rails
* Using basic command operations in Rails
* Setting up a database system and integrating it with Rails
* Enhancing the user interface with Bootstrap
* Building a login system using the Gem-Devise
* The associations between models
* Understanding the fundamental framework of Rails and its capabilities

This project provides an excellent opportunity to develop your skills and deepen your understanding of Ruby on Rails. Happy coding!
